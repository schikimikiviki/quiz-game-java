0. Consider using Swift.

1. Design the structure of the quiz game:

- Define the classes and objects you'll need, such as Question, Quiz, and Player.
- Determine how to store and retrieve questions for the quiz (e.g., hardcoding them or reading from a file).

2. Implement the Question class:

- Define instance variables for the question text and the correct answer.
- Create appropriate getter and setter methods.
- Include a method to check if a given answer matches the correct answer.

3. Implement the Quiz class:

- Decide on the number of questions per quiz and the scoring system.
- Create an array or ArrayList to store the questions.
- Write methods to add questions to the quiz, retrieve a random question, and keep track of the player's score.

4. Implement the Player class:

- Include instance variables to store the player's name and score.
- Write appropriate getter and setter methods.

5. Develop the main game logic:

- Initialize the quiz by adding questions.
- Prompt the player to enter their name.
- Start the game loop.
- Present a random question to the player and receive their answer.
- Check if the answer is correct and update the player's score accordingly.
- Repeat steps for the desired number of questions.
- Display the player's final score at the end of the quiz.

6. Add extra features and enhancements:

- Implement a timer to limit the time for each question.
- Include a leaderboard to track high scores.
- Create different difficulty levels or categories of questions.
- Enable the option for players to choose the number of questions they want in a quiz.

7. Test the quiz game:

- Run the program and test various scenarios to ensure it functions correctly.
Check for any potential bugs or issues and fix them as necessary.
